# Boxing-History-Quiz
20 questions about the history of the heavy weight boxing.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first code that I upload on GitHub and it's actually my first real code. I used the C language to create a quiz 
containing 20 questions,correcting it and assessing your knowlege of the boxing history in heavy weight category.It starts from 
1890s and goes on chronologically. You can see the result  after each step. **clang version 10.0.0-4ubuntu1** was used to 
compile the code. It's just a trial and certainlly far from perfect, anyway it's compiled and run flawlessly. Propositions for 
improving the code are always welcom.
